I'm working as software developer since 2018 and before I've learned something about programming languages by myself.
I originally learned the profession of an electronics technician. And there I started with simple programs for little helpful applications, written in Basic via Visual Basic. I wanted to be platform independent and so I taught myself Java. And on my freetime I've reading something about and playing with web technologies like PHP, HTML, JavaScript and so on.

## What I'm actually doing
In my current job I develop mainly in Java and I am a specialist for an application that was originally developed with the WebObjects framework.
So now I can say my actually personal skills include
- Java and it's ecosystem
  
  Frameworks:
  - Springboot
  - WebObjects

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript

  Frameworks:
  - Bootstrap
  - VueJS

- Docker

## What I would like to learn in the future
I'm very inquisitive and at the time I would like to spend some time to contribute to the development of open source projects. I am currently looking for suitable projects here on GitHub.
In the further future, I would like to deepen my work in web projects and further explore AI and machine learning.
