    I'm working as software developer since 2018 and before I've learned something about programming languages by myself.
    I originally learned the profession of an electronics technician. And there I started with simple programs for little helpful applications, written in Basic via Visual Basic. I wanted to be platform independent and so I taught myself Java. On my freetime I've reading something about and playing with web technologies like PHP, HTML, JavaScript and so on. 
    The last few years in permanent teams and software products have brought me a great deal of qualitative and technical progress. These brought me exactly where I am now. Into full self-employment as a software developer for various projects and customers.
